<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aseprite/aseprite.zig.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aseprite/aseprite.zig) -->

This is a [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) library to read (possibly write) and work with [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) files.

## Goals:

- [ ] Support a large subset of the Aseprite file format
    - [ ] Read .aseprite files
    - [ ] **TBD**
- [ ] Create a powerful API to work with Aseprite files
- [ ] Create a utility library/cli to make it easy to use Aseprite files in your own projects
   - [ ] Create texture atlases from Aseprite files

## Non-goals (initially):

- [ ] Support the entire Aseprite file format
- [ ] Write .aseprite files
